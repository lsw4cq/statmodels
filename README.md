# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### City Bikes
### Foursquare
### Yelp
1. Review the documentation and figure out which URL I needed to pull
2. Develop a request that pulled results for one location to see structure of return
3. Figured out the map for accessing the information I needed
4. Wrote code that iterated through the station data and pulled POIs for each station
5. Created a dataframe with parsed data
6. Checked for duplicates
    * Duplicates were found. The only difference between the duplicates was the distance from the station so all were eliminated and distance can no longer be used reliably as a method of analysis for the Yelp data.

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
